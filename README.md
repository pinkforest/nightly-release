following command from inside this repository:

    cargo install --path cli --force --locked

Or directly from our seed node:

    cargo install radicle-cli --force --locked --git https://seed.alt-clients.radicle.xyz/radicle-cli.git

> **Note**
> It's recommended to install release builds since development builds may be incompatible with the network.

following command from inside this repository:

    docker build . -t rad

### üêß From APT (Debian/Ubuntu)

    curl -fsSL https://europe-west6-apt.pkg.dev/doc/repo-signing-key.gpg | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/radicle-archive-keyring.gpg > /dev/null

Then update your sources list with the radicle repository by creating a registry file:

    echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/radicle-archive-keyring.gpg] https://europe-west6-apt.pkg.dev/projects/radicle-services radicle-cli main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/radicle-registry.list

Then update the package list and install `radicle-cli`:

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install radicle-cli

### üç∫ From Homebrew (x86_64)
